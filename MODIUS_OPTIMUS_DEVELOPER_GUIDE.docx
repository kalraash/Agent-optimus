## 1. What is Modius/Optimus - General Overview

### Basic Concept

Modius/Optimus is an autonomous agent system that automatically manages cryptocurrency investments across multiple decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols. The system operates without human intervention, making investment decisions based on predefined algorithms and risk parameters.

The system runs as an agent service built on the Open Autonomy framework, which provides a multi-agent consensus mechanism. This means multiple agent instances work together to reach agreement on investment decisions before executing them.

### Core Networks and Protocols

The system operates across four blockchain networks:

• Ethereum Mainnet: Used primarily for staking operations with the Olas protocol. The system participates in Olas staking to earn additional rewards and meet Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

• Optimism: The primary trading network where most liquidity provision activities occur. Supports Uniswap V3, Balancer, and Velodrome protocols.

• Base: Coinbase's Layer 2 network, supporting Uniswap V3 and Balancer protocols for additional investment opportunities.

• Mode: An emerging Layer 2 network primarily supporting Velodrome protocol, providing access to new yield farming opportunities.

### Supported DeFi Protocols

• Uniswap V3: Concentrated liquidity protocol where the system provides liquidity within specific price ranges to earn trading fees.

• Balancer: Automated market maker supporting both weighted pools (multiple tokens with different weights) and stable pools (similar-value tokens).

• Velodrome: Optimism-native DEX supporting both standard automated market maker pools and concentrated liquidity pools.

• Sturdy: Yield aggregation protocol that automatically optimizes returns across multiple lending platforms.

### Investment Philosophy

The system follows a conservative, data-driven approach. It doesn't chase every high-yield opportunity but instead evaluates investments based on:

- Risk assessment of the underlying protocol
- Expected annual percentage rate (APR) calculations
- Current market conditions and volatility
- Portfolio diversification requirements
- Transaction costs versus potential returns

---

## 2. How the System Works - Core Mechanics

### 24-Hour Operational Cycle

The system operates in structured 24-hour cycles called epochs. Each epoch follows a specific sequence of activities:

• Initialization Phase: The system starts by checking the health of all components, synchronizing data across networks, and updating the status of existing positions.

• Discovery Phase: The system scans for new investment opportunities by checking liquidity mining campaigns on the Merkl platform and analyzing current APR rates across all supported protocols.

• Analysis Phase: New opportunities are compared against current positions using sophisticated algorithms that consider risk-adjusted returns, portfolio impact, and transaction costs.

• Decision Phase: The system makes final investment decisions based on the analysis, preparing detailed transaction plans for any position changes.

• Execution Phase: Approved transactions are simulated using Tenderly, then executed on the appropriate blockchain networks.

• Settlement Phase: The system monitors transaction confirmations, updates position records, and calculates performance metrics.

### Decision-Making Process

The system uses a multi-layered decision-making process:

• Minimum Threshold Check: Any opportunity must offer at least 5% APR to be considered for investment.

• Comparative Analysis: When the system already has an active position, it only considers switching if the new opportunity offers significantly better returns based on the trading type:
- Balanced mode requires 33.74% improvement
- Risky mode requires 28.92% improvement

• Risk Assessment: Each opportunity is evaluated for protocol risk, asset volatility, liquidity depth, and smart contract security.

• Portfolio Impact: The system ensures any new position maintains proper diversification across protocols, networks, and assets.

• Cost-Benefit Analysis: Transaction costs (gas fees, slippage) are weighed against potential additional returns.

### Consensus Mechanism

The system uses a Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus mechanism where multiple agent instances must agree on decisions. This prevents any single component from making unauthorized changes and ensures system reliability.

Each decision goes through multiple rounds of consensus where agents share their analysis and vote on the proposed action. Only when a majority agrees does the system proceed with execution.

## 3. System Architecture and Components

### Agent Service Layer

The core of the system is built on the Open Autonomy framework, which provides:

**Multi-Agent Coordination**: Multiple agent instances run simultaneously, each capable of making independent decisions but requiring consensus for execution.

**Fault Tolerance**: If one agent fails, others continue operating, ensuring system reliability.

**State Synchronization**: All agents maintain synchronized state information about portfolio positions, market conditions, and system configuration.

### Skill Modules

The system is organized into specialized skill modules:

**Liquidity Trader ABCI**: Contains the core trading logic, including strategy evaluation, position management, and transaction execution.

**Optimus ABCI**: Provides application-level coordination, handling consensus mechanisms, transaction validation, and system monitoring.

### Behavior Components
